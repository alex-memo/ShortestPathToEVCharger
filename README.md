#How to use

Type a valid node in the script Program under startingNode ex "A" then run, if you would like to print all the nodes when created on line 8 place a parameter true inside setNodes() so it prints all nodes after creating them setNodes(true);

In case the application does not run as intended on the code editor of preference, you can use your command line (Cmd / Terminal / etc..) and first verify your dot net installation by running "dotnet " if the command returns something then dotnet is installed, if not install it. When dotnet is installed just write "dotnet" and drag the dll file inside the command line and run it.
